## 📉 Trading Strategy & Example

The engine uses a multi-factor, technical analysis-based strategy, combining:

- **EMA Crossovers:** Detects trend changes using fast/slow Exponential Moving Averages (e.g., 20/50 EMA).
- **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** Identifies overbought/oversold conditions and momentum shifts.
- **ATR (Average True Range):** Measures volatility for adaptive stop-loss and take-profit levels.
- **Market Structure:** Recognizes Break of Structure (BOS) and Change of Character (CHoCH) for trend confirmation.
- **Order Blocks & Fair Value Gaps:** Finds institutional trading zones and price imbalances.
- **Candlestick Patterns:** Engulfing, pinbars, and doji for entry/exit timing.
- **Divergence:** Detects momentum divergence between price and RSI for early reversal signals.
- **Multi-Timeframe Analysis:** Confirms signals across different timeframes for higher accuracy.
- **Risk Management:** Each trade uses a fixed risk percentage (e.g., 1% of equity), with ATR-based stop-loss and multi-level take-profits.

### Example Trade Flow

1. **Signal Generation:**  
   - EURUSD 1h chart: 20 EMA crosses above 50 EMA (bullish), RSI is 45 (not overbought), bullish order block detected.
   - Signal: **BUY** at 1.1000, Stop Loss (SL) at 1.0980 (ATR-based), Take Profit (TP1) at 1.1020, TP2 at 1.1040.

2. **Position Sizing:**  
   - Account equity: $10,000  
   - Risk per trade: 1% ($100)  
   - Distance to SL: 20 pips (0.0020)  
   - Position size: $100 / 0.0020 = 50,000 units (0.5 lot, for illustration)

3. **Trade Outcome:**  
   - Price hits TP1 (1.1020): Profit = (1.1020 - 1.1000) × 50,000 = $1,000  
   - Price reverses and hits SL: Loss = (1.1000 - 1.0980) × 50,000 = $1,000  
   - With risk management, only $100 is lost (1% of equity), as the position is closed at SL.

### Example Profit/Loss Calculation

| Scenario         | Entry   | SL      | TP1     | Position Size | Result | P/L      |
|------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------------|--------|----------|
| Win (TP1 hit)    | 1.1000  | 1.0980  | 1.1020  | 50,000        | TP1    | +$1,000  |
| Loss (SL hit)    | 1.1000  | 1.0980  | 1.1020  | 50,000        | SL     | -$1,000* |

*With risk management, the actual loss is capped at the predefined risk per trade (e.g., $100).
